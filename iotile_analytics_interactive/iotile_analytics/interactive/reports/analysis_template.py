    AnalysisGroup object which is to be taken as the target of whatever
    operation needs to be performed.

    instance, i.e. it cannot complete fully offline using just the AnalysisGroup,

    def run(self, output_path, file_handler=None):
        """Run whatever analysis this class implements.

        The analysis should be saved in the location specified by output_path.
        The output_path parameter should not be taken as the literal location
        to save the output but rather suggestive of where it should be saved,
        you may decide to append an extension or remove one and create a
        directory containing your results, for example.

        If you are only creating a single file then you can use output_path as
        you see fit to generate your output file name as described above.  If
        you generate multiple files then those files **must** be all contained
        inside a directory at ``output_path`` that you generate.  This is very
        important so that your caller can easily bundle your files into a zip
        and remove the originals if necessary.

        If output_path is None then you are expected to write your output to
        stdout.  If that is not possible for the analysis you are performing,
        e.g. you are creating multiple files, then you should raise
        UsageError().

        Args:
            output_path (str): A location specifying where we should save the
                output of the analysis.
            file_handler (callable): A function that will be given a bytes
                object for each file that this report generates as well as
                the relative path to that file.  If you override this function,
                it is your responsibility to save all of these files, otherwise
                no output will be generated.  The purpose of this argument is
                to allow for streaming these files to a remote server or some
                other action that is not just saving the data to a local disk.

                The default behavior is to just save to local disk, which happens
                if file_handler is None (the default value).  The signature
                of file_handler should be file_handler(path, contents) where
                contents is a bytes object.

        Returns:
            list(str): A list of all of the files generated during the running of this analysis.

            The first file in the list should be considered the "main
            entry point" of the analysis.  For example, if you are rendering an
            html file with supporting data in a directory, you should return the
            html file first and either a list of all the data files or the data
            directory itself.  Returning a directory from this function will be
            interpreted as returning all files recursively contained in that directory.

            If running this report generates no files you should return an empty
            list.
